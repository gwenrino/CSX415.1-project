# Predicting Dengue Disease

This project, in which I attempt to use NOAA weather data to predict weekly cases of dengue disease in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was inspired by [this Driven Data competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/80/). 

I am working on this project in the context of the UC Berkeley Extension course CompSci 415.1, "Data Science Principles and Practices."
