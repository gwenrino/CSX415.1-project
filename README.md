# CSX415.1 Final Project: Prediction of Dengue Fever  

*OVERVIEW*  

The goal of this project is to use data science methods to increase efficiency in staffing an imaginary public health clinic in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The approach is to forecast the number of weekly dengue patients using U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather data, and then to recommend staffing the clinic with the number of health care workers required to care for the forecasted number of patients.  

*PROJECT ORGANIZATION*  

This project uses the [Project Template](http://projecttemplate.net/) management system, and project assets are stored acording to the ProjectTemplate folder structure.

Running the following commands with `CSX415.1-project/dengue` as the working directory will load and munge the necessary data to run the project.

```
