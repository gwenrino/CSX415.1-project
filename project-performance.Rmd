## Naive Model
### April 11, 2018

My baseline model predicts the number of cases of dengue per week to be equal to the average number of cases for that season of the year.

Comparing these predictions to the actual number of cases yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 25.5.

In order to meet the required model performance level established in the FPS, a future model must reduce the MAE by 21.5.

Code is here:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Find mean total_cases for each season
dengue.sj %>% group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(total_cases, na.rm = TRUE))

# Assign seasonal mean as prediction for each observation
dengue.sj.naive <- dengue.sj %>% 
  mutate(predictions = case_when(season == "fall" ~ 59.2,
                                 season == "spring" ~ 11.9,
                                 season == "summer" ~ 41.6,
                                 season == "winter" ~ 23.9))

# Error = actual number of cases - predicted number of cases
error <- dengue.sj.naive$total_cases - dengue.sj.naive$predictions

# Function that returns Mean Absolute Error
mae <- function(error)
{
  mean(abs(error))
}

# Find MAE for naive model
mae(error)
```
