My baseline model predicts the number of cases of dengue per week to be equal to the average number of cases for that season of the year.

Comparing these predictions to the actual number of cases yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 25.5.

In order to meet the required model performance level established in the FPS, a future model must reduce the MAE by 21.5.
