This directory includes all final reports for the project:

**FORMAL PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/FormalProblemStatement.pdf  
* Description:  
This initial report includes an overview of the problem, background on the context, a list of stakeholders, the project's success metrics and risk estimates, an explanation of how the model will be deployed, and a timeline for the project.  

**MODELS**  
* Paths:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/0.NaiveEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/1.LinearEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/2.TreeEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/3.ArimaEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/4.DynRegEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/5.VAREval.pdf  
* Description:   
Each of these reports describes one model and evaluates it according to its Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The R scripts modeling the data using each algorithm can be found in the directory ~CSX415.1-project/dengue/src/Models/.  

**ABOUT THE MODEL**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/AboutModel.pdf  
* Description:  
This report explains in general terms how the forecasting tool works, and interprets the potential impact of the tool by way of examples of the cost savings that would have been incurred had the tool been in use during three 6-week periods in the past.
