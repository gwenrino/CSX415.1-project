## Model description  

In order to establish a baseline measure of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for dengue prediction models, I created a naive model that predicts the number of cases of dengue per week to be equal to the average number of cases for that season of the year.

```{r}

source("~./src/LoadData/Load.R") # HELP
source("~./src/Munge/Munge.r") # HELP

# Find mean total_cases for fall, spring, summer, winter
dengue %>% group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(total_cases, na.rm = TRUE))

# Assign seasonal mean as prediction for each observation
dengue.naive <- dengue %>% 
  mutate(predictions = case_when(season == "fall" ~ 59.2,
                                 season == "spring" ~ 11.9,
                                 season == "summer" ~ 41.6,
                                 season == "winter" ~ 23.9))

predictions <- dengue.naive$predictions
```

## Model evaluation  

The baseline MAE is 25.5.

```{r}
# Error = actual number of cases - predicted number of cases
error <- dengue.naive$total_cases - predictions

# Find MAE
mean(abs(error))
```
