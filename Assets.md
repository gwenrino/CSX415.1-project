**DATA**  

**DrivenData files**  
* Paths:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/data/dengue\_features\_train.csv  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/data/dengue\_labels\_train.csv  
* Description:  
These are the data files from the [DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/) sponsored by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/). 

**Puerto Rico Tourism Company files**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/data/hotel.guests.copy.csv  
* Description:  
This is data on monthly non-resident hotel guests extracted from files from the [Statistics.PR website](https://estadisticas.pr/inventario-de-estadisticas/puerto_rico_tourism_company).  

OUTPUTS
-------

**FORMAL PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/FormalProblemStatement.pdf  
* Description:  
This initial report includes an overview of the problem, background on the context, a list of stakeholders, the project's success metrics and risk estimates, an explanation of how the model will be deployed, and a timeline for the project.  

**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/src/EDA/EDA.R  
* Description:  
This R script consists of initial exploratory data analysis, including tests for Pearson correlations between variables and for autocorrelations in the time series.  

**DATA VISUALIZATIONS**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/graphs/EDAviz/  
* Description:  
This directory contains the most instructive data visualization plots generated by ~CSX415.1-project/dengue/src/EDA/EDA.viz.R and other R scripts. There is a histogram of the response variable, a bar graph of the average number of dengue cases per week of the year, a basic time series plot, and a plot of the autocorrelation function (ACF).  

**FEATURE SELECTION**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/src/FeatureSelection/FeatureSelection.R  
* Description:  
This R script utilizes the randomForest::importance() function and the earth::evimp() function to develop a list of features that may be most important in modeling the data.  

**MODELS**  
* Paths:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/0.NaiveEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/1.LinearEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/2.TreeEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/3.ArimaEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/4.DynRegEval.pdf  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/ModelEvaluations/5.VAREval.pdf  
* Description:   
Each of these reports describes one model and evaluates it according to its Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The R scripts modeling the data using each algorithm can be found in the directory ~CSX415.1-project/dengue/src/Models/.  

**PACKAGE**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/pkgs/Dengue  
* Description:  
This package contains the function DengueFC(), a forecasting tool which can be used to forecast weekly cases of dengue disease in San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as to recommend the number of clinic staff required to meet the needs of the forecasted number of patients.  

**ABOUT THE MODEL**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/dengue/reports/AboutModel.pdf  
* Description:  
This report explains in general terms how the forecasting tool works, and interprets the potential impact of the tool by way of examples of the cost savings that would have been incurred had the tool been in use during three 6-week periods in the past.  

**USING THE MODEL**  
* Path:  
~CSX415.1-project/deploy/README.md  
* Description:  
This markdown document includes instructions for installing, using, and interpreting the output of the forecasting tool as well as other components of the project.
